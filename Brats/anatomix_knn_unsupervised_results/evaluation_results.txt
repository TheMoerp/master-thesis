ANATOMIX + KNN UNSUPERVISED ANOMALY DETECTION RESULTS
============================================================
METHODOLOGY:
- Anatomix pre-trained features for representation learning
- KNN-based anomaly detection with FAISS for efficiency
- Subject-level data splitting (no patient overlap)
- Threshold determined using ONLY normal validation data
- No test label access during threshold selection
